# UNICEF-Predicting-Conflict-Escalation
Addressing societal conflicts by preparing for potential havoc in different countries through utilising statistical &amp; data science methods to implement a meta-model that tells us which of the 3 machine-learning models (Transformers, FFNN, and xgboost) curated by UNICEF best predict conflict escalations. Worked with data provided by UNICEF.
